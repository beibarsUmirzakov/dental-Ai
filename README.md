⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a **demo version** created and adapted by me specifically for internship interviews.

Some features like:
- API integration
- ESLint/Prettier configuration
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Automated testing

are not yet implemented but are planned and can be easily added as the structure is ready.

The goal of this version is to demonstrate:
✅ Understanding of React component structure  
✅ Routing and state handling  
✅ UI layout and modular code  
✅ Willingness to grow and improve professionally

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you'd like to see future iterations with full functionality.
